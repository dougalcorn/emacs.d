;;; Commentary:

;; Just fold the active region, please.
;;
;; ## How it works
;;
;; The command `fold-this` visually replaces the current region with `...`.
;; If you move point into the ellipsis and press enter or `C-g` it is unfolded.
;;
;; You can unfold everything with `fold-this-unfold-all`.
;;
;; You can fold all instances of the text in the region with `fold-this-all`.
;;
;; ## Setup
;;
;; I won't presume to know which keys you want these functions bound to,
;; so you'll have to set that up for yourself. Here's some example code,
;; which incidentally is what I use:
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-f") 'fold-this-all)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-F") 'fold-this)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c M-f") 'fold-this-unfold-all)

;;; Code:

(defvar fold-this-keymap (make-sparse-keymap))
(define-key fold-this-keymap (kbd "<return>") 'fold-this-unfold-at-point)
(define-key fold-this-keymap (kbd "C-g") 'fold-this-unfold-at-point)

;;;###autoload
(defun fold-this (beg end)
  (interactive "r")
  (let ((o (make-overlay beg end nil t nil)))
    (overlay-put o 'type 'fold-this)
    (overlay-put o 'invisible t)
    (overlay-put o 'keymap fold-this-keymap)
    (overlay-put o 'modification-hooks '(fold-this--unfold-overlay))
    (overlay-put o 'display ".")
    (overlay-put o 'before-string ".")
    (overlay-put o 'evaporate t))
  (deactivate-mark))

;;;###autoload
(defun fold-this-all (beg end)
  (interactive "r")
  (let ((string (buffer-substring (region-beginning)
                                  (region-end))))
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (search-forward string (point-max) t)
        (fold-this (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)))))
  (deactivate-mark))

  (when (region-active-p)
    (fold-this beg end)))

  (when (eq (overlay-get it 'type) 'fold-this)
    (delete-overlay it)))

(defun fold-this--unfold-overlay (overlay after? beg end &optional length)
  (delete-overlay overlay))
